Hello Fellow Humans!! I am an Entrepreneur and am learning how to code. I am so excited and grateful to embark on this journey with Codecademy and Purdue Univeristy Global.


### My story

I am a loving wife to my husband of 31 years. We have three children and I have been working since I was 16. I have always used a computer in my jobs and now I get to look into the inner workings of the computer. Did I say How Excited I Am!!
